  <h4><u><b>About Janice</b></u></h4> 
  <p>
      <pre>
    Janice is a voice assitant I created on my own written in python. She uses Google's text to speech API and she can be modified 
in a variety of ways. Janice analyzes the speech and based on what is being said, she gives a hard programmed response. For example, 
if I said, "Janice I'm with my friend right be nice", she would respond,"hello friend". I started to work on her in order to practice
for my chemistry test. I would hard program answers and would ask her questions to hear her say things outloud when I would forget the 
answer. It was really fun making her, and she's probably the best project I've made so far. My next project will be similar to Janice,
but I will try and include some Ai so I don't have to hard program everything.
